Password strength checker  
I have made a very simple but effective project to check strength of a password. 
In today’s it very important to keep our data secure as its has became very easy 
hack or steal information from a device. We should be aware and prevent our 
data for this purpose having a strong password plays major role. So to check 
that whether the passwords we use is safe I have made this project in which you  
can enter your password and check whether its weak, medium or strong. 


Working and Logic  
1) Take input from user  
2) Checking various parameters like  
a) Checking length  
b) Checking digits  
c) Checking uppercase and lowercase 
d) Checking special characters  
e) Rejecting very common passwords 
3)Decide whether password is weak, medium, strong . 
4)This will continue in a loop until user enter ‘quit’ 
5)Task end

 Technologies used  
1) Python 3 
2) Used re  module for checking special characters  
3) Used conditional statements , loops , string functions , etc..


How to run the program  
1)Install python 3 
2) Open Terminal  
3) Run the command : 
Python password_checker.py  
4)Type a password and press Enter  
5) To  exit type: 
quit
